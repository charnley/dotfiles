# Mac OSX

So you want to have a Debian i3wm-like workflow on mac? Too bad.
Well, this is as close you will get. First to do anything you'll need brew and standard GNU tools.
And before that you'll need to setup xcode.

    xcode-select --install
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

with xcode and brew setup, we can then install all the standard tools you are use too.
I Manage all my brew packages in a Brewfile located in `lists`.

    brew bundle --file ./lists/gnu.Brewfile  # install all expected terminal tools

## Window manager and i3-like setup

I use Yabai, Skhd and alacritty. Yabai is the window manager, and skhd is the shortcut manager.
To install alacritty without having Mac OSX complain about the unsafe application use.

    export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--no-quarantine"

Install the packages

    brew bundle --file ./lists/i3like.Brewfile  # install window manager, and terminal to make it feel like i3wm

Then start the services. When starting each service the first time you will be prompted by Mac to add the service in

    System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessbility

Please check of each service when prompted

    brew services start yabai
    brew services start skhd

Some shortcuts are not manageable with skhd. Let's setup Desktop switching. First create all 10 Desktops. Press Ctrl - Up and find the "+" on the right side. Add until you have 1-9 Desktops. Then to fix shortcuts goto

    System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Mission Control
    Select each "Switch to Desktop X" and change it to Cmd + X

Fix spaces reordering automatically.

    System Preferences -> Mission Control
    uncheck the option "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use".

Note, yabai will only work with "Displays have seperate Spaces" enabled

    System Preferences -> Mission Control
    check the option "Displays have seperate Spaces".

There are other settings that might be worth changing see https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Tips-and-tricks

## Extra Mac Settings

Change the default colour look for mac

    System Preferences -> General
    Set "Appearance" to "Dark"

Disable the animation when switching desktops and reduce transparency.

    System Preferences -> Accesibility -> Display
    Check "Reduce motion"
    Check "Reduce transparency"


The mac bar at the bottom is taking a lot of space. Let's remove it by default

    System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar
    Check "Automatically hide and show the Dock"
    Uncheck "Animate opening applications"
    Change "Size" to your liking

For editing documents (especially in the browser), home & end jumps to the bottom of the page.

## Mac hardware

### Mouse

To change the direction of the mouse scroll

    System Preferences -> Mouse -> Scroll direction (uncheck)

### Keyboard

If you are like me, and never use Caps for anything, change it to Cmd (Super) for extra easy modifier
This needs to be done per-new external keyboard.

    System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifiers
    Select keyboard
    Change caps to command


### Mac shortcuts

The default keyboard shortcut for screenshot is pretty f*cked on mac. Change it.

    System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Screenshots
    Change "Save picture of selected area as a file"

My default is "Cmd + p". Uncheck the rest, as you probably use those shortcuts for other things.

# TODO

    yabai float toggle shortcut
    yabai reset layout, useful for when moving between docks/screen

    disable ALL BELL, turned down system bell

    pageup / pagedown / home / end on mac keyboard

    pull-down termina, cmd+shift+enter = open a tmp terminal for fast commands

    timer.py, from terminal "set timer with note" fast


# Tips

 - Set paste-without-format to a more sane default. Instead of pressing
   `Cmd+V`, press `Opt+Shft+Cmd+V` to paste text without any formatting.

- Problems with command after pipe?
